## Analizing Web Page

So this webpage is basically for a small chair design shop in Lisbon. So these guys are basically designers or architects who built these minimalist chairs.

And so clearly, we are going to want to give this interface here a clean and modern look.

So what that means is that we're gonna reach for a _sans-serif_ of typeface.

And one of the sans-serif of typefaces that I like the most, especially for something like designers or architects, would be _Inter_.
