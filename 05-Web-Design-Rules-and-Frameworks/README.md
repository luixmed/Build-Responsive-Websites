## Analizing Web Page

So this webpage is basically for a small chair design shop in Lisbon. So these guys are basically designers or architects who built these minimalist chairs.

And so clearly, we are going to want to give this interface here a clean and modern look.

So what that means is that we're gonna reach for a _sans-serif_ of typeface.

And one of the sans-serif of typefaces that I like the most, especially for something like designers or architects, would be _Inter_.

## Font Size

So one of the things that I mentioned in the last lecture is that when it comes to choosing font sizes, it's good to have a system, because with that, we do not have to always think about what size we want to give to a certain element. That would be a lot of work, and it would also lead to inconsistent results.

So I have this system here, and whenever I need to choose a font size, I can only choose one of these different options.

## FONT SIZE SYSTEM (px)

10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98
